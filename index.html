			<p>Guts, renowned as the "Black Swordsman", 
                is a former mercenary and branded wanderer 
                who travels the world in a constant internal 
                struggle between pursuing his own ends and 
                upholding his attachments to those dear to him. </p>
                <br/>
            <p>At one time driven solely by his will to survive,
                Guts finds purpose in life upon joining the Band of the Falcon, 
                greatly helping in the faction's storied successes during the Hundred-Year War as captain of the band's raiders. 
                He eventually becomes dissatisfied with clinging to Griffith's dream and departs from the band in pursuit of his own.
                Following the horrors of the Eclipse prompted by Griffith, 
                Guts embarks on a two-year war against the God Hand and apostles, 
                becoming increasingly embittered on his one-track quest for retribution. 
                He in time realizes protecting his regressed lover is more important to him,
                as well as something he cannot do alone, and thus puts aside his quest for revenge while fostering camaraderie with new companions. </p>
